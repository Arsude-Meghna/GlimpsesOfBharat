        <p> Ganges River, Hindi Ganga, great river of the plains of the northern Indian subcontinent. 
            Although officially as well as popularly called the Ganga in Hindi and in other Indian languages, 
            internationally it is known by its conventional name, the Ganges. From time immemorial it has been the holy river of Hinduism. 
            For most of its course it is a wide and sluggish stream, flowing through one of the most fertile and densely populated regions in the world. 
            Despite its importance, its length of 1,560 miles (2,510 km) is relatively short compared with the other great rivers of Asia or of the world.

                    Banyans are the world’s biggest trees in terms of the area they cover. The biggest one alive today is in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. 
                    It covers 1.9 hectares (4.7 acres) and can shelter 20,000 people.</p>

      <P>Hockey is one of the oldest games and was approved by the Indian Hockey Federation in 1925.
                         The first international hockey tour for Indians was played against New Zealand, with 21 games, of which India won 18. 
                         These victories helped the Indian hockey team stand out and encouraged Indian citizens to play hockey.
                          Hockey was popular from 1928 to 1956. 
                          This period was considered a golden era, as India won six consecutive gold medals at the Olympic Games.

         This is why hockey was treated as the national game of India.</P>

             <P>The Ganges river dolphin can only live in freshwater and is essentially blind. 
                            They hunt by emitting ultrasonic sounds, which bounces off of fish and other prey, enabling them to “see” an image in their mind. 
                            They are frequently found alone or in small groups, and generally a mother and calf travel together. 
                            Calves are chocolate brown at birth and then have grey-brown smooth, hairless skin as adults. 
                            Females are larger than males and give birth once every two to three years to only one calf.

Well, today the amount would be close to $1 Billion.
                                        About 28 types of precious and semi-precious stones were used for adorning the Taj and they were sourced from Tibet, China, Sri Lanka and some parts of India. The Taj Mahal is recognized as one of the wonders of the world and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

        <p> It was originally known as “Qila-e-Mubarak”. This name simplifies to “The Blessed Fort”. Shah Jahan built this fort when he made a decision to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi.
                                            When the fort was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1648, it was white in colour  built with sandstones. Not only did the name, but the colour of the fort was also changed to red. All of it took place at the behest of the British. The Red Fort was originally made of lime stones. It was when the white stone began chipping off, the British had to paint it with red. </p>

                     <p>At 182 metres, Statue of Unity is the tallest statue in the world. The statue faces the Narmada Dam and is located on a river island called Sadhu Bet near Rajpipla on Narmada River. 
                                                            It is located between the Satpura and the Vindhya mountain ranges near Kevadia town in Gujarat. Over 3,000 workers, including 300 engineers from Larsen & Toubro (L&T), built the statue within three-and-a-half years.
                                                            Around 129 tonnes of iron implements were obtained from nearly 100 million farmers in 169,000 villages across all states for the statue. The statue will be able to withstand earthquakes and wind speed up to around 100 km per second.

                    <P>Howrah Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans over the Hooghly River in West Bengal. A cantilever bridge is the one built using cantilevers, structures that project horizontally into space, supported on only one end.
                                                                The bridge does not have nuts and bolts and was built by riveting the whole structure. At the time of its construction, it was the 3rd longest cantilever bridge. Now, it is the sixth-longest bridge of its type in the world!
                                                                It carries a daily traffic of approximately 100,000 vehicles and possibly more than 150,000 pedestrians, making it one of the busiest cantilever bridges in the world. 
                                                                The first vehicle to use the bridge was a solitary tram.
